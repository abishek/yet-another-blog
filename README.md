# yet-another-blog

A common lisp based blog engine written from scratch based on caveman2 framework. I use postgresql for a database. The code is very elementary at this stage. I see a long way to go before it is functional. Meanwhile, I think it helps others find small undocumented solutions to problems using caveman or other libraries. 

When it works, I'll have this made available via quicklisp and docker.
